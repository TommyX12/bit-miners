// If you're reading this you're probably trapped inside a room with a robot.
// I've left a few of these flimsy disks around to help you get through 
// the problems you'll face!

// These two slashes you see means that anything written afterwards

// They're known as "comments"
// I'll leave comments in the programs I write to try and help you out.

// Below is a program that will tell the drone to move in a direction

// the events you see at the bottom left are run at specific points in time.
// Only code written in these events will work!

// events are preceded with the "when" keyword. So when something "start"s 
// it runs the code inside! 
// Start is only called once when the robot starts up after you code it.

// By the way. Use the arrow keys to move around in the script!

when start(){
	move_in_direction(1,-1)
	// move_in_direction is a instruction you send to the robot.
	// It tells the robot to move in a direction. But what direction!? 
	// It takes two more pieces of information called "arguments" to tell the 
	// robot how to move.
	
	// The first argument is the horizontal movement. 
		// If you pass a negative number it will move to the right. 
		// If you pass a positive number it will move to the left!
	
	// The second argument, 
	// separated by a comma from the first is the vertical movement.
		// If you pass in a nevative number it will move down.
		// If you pass in a positive number it will move up!


	// The code worked as-is for me. but they may have moved the pressure pad 
	// since I was last there.
	// You may need to edit the arguments to get it to work properly!
